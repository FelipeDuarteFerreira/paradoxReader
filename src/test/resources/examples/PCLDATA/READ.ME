This diskette contains Paradox databases with information on HP's
PCL (Printer Control Language) and printers which support various
commands.  Note that a printer may support a command but not all
possible parameters.  For an obvious example, the LaserJet series
have no tractor feed option so you cannot select continuous paper
for them.  Changes, additions, and corrections gratefully accepted.
